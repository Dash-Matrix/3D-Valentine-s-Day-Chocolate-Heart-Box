Things to Keep in Mind, When Freshly opened, there will be two things to adjust.

- Update Font by going to C:\Windows\Fonts folder and choose "Brush Script MT Italic" font from Blender
- Go the Shading window and in world shading mode open with Environment Texture and go to C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender {your version}\{your version}\datafiles\studiolights\world and add "courtyard.exr"
